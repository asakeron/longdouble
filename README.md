longdouble
==========

longdouble contains an implementation of 106 bit precision floating point
and associated mathematical operations. It is intended mainly to preserve
robustness in calculations of values stored in a double format, rather
than to provide a high precision numeric type in it's own right.

## Installation

Add longdouble to the pubspec.yaml file in the main directory of
your application

# Libraries

## longdouble

Contains the longdouble class definition

## longdouble.math

Contains various mathematical operations on the longdouble datatype,
with an api similar to the `dart:math` library
